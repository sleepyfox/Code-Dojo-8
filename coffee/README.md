# Anagram kata
This is my worked example from the 8th meeting of the London Code Dojo in Jun 2012. Feel free to play around with it. Assuming you have Node.js installed you can install all dependencies with

    npm install

and run the tests with:

    npm test

I set up a watchr file (kata.watchr) so that the tests are run automatically every time you save a file in your editor, simply run watchr (if installed) with:
    
    watchr kata.watchr

The source of the kata is the Anagram Kata that you can find [here](http://codekata.com/kata/kata06-anagrams/). I've also linked the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/u/sleepyfox/p/code-dojo-8-jun-2012) from the meeting.
