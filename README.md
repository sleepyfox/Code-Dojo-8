# Anagram kata
In this repo are worked examples from the Anagram kata. The source of the kata is Dave Thomas of the Pragmatic Programmers and more info can be found  [here](http://codekata.com/kata/kata06-anagrams/). I've also linked the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/u/sleepyfox/p/code-dojo-8-jun-2012) from the Code Dojo meeting. You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
