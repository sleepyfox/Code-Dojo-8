Code Dojo 8
===========
This is my worked example from the 8th meeting of the London Code Dojo in Jun 2012. Feel free to play around with it. You can run the code (assuming you have node and coffeescript installed) with:

    jasmine-node --coffee --verbose test-*

I set up a watchr file (kata.watchr) so that the tests are run automatically every time you save a file in your editor, simply run watchr (if you have it installed) with:
    
    watchr kata.watchr

The source of the kata is the Anagram Kata that you can find [here](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_six_anagra.html). I've also linked the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/u/sleepyfox/p/code-dojo-8-jun-2012) from the meeting. You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
